        <div class="subheading mb-5">Proffesional Model</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I was born and raised for my first 10 years in India. I worked with my family as a model for the pictures we had up in our shop which helped get me started in my passion for modelling. When I moved to America with my family I tried out modelling here but it was hard to get anything so I started to lose my passion but I found many opportunities after middle school and even modelled for Hollister and H&M. This really helped me to get my dream back and pursue Modelling again as it gave me a major boost in both job opportunities and confidence. These days I am working with Aeropostale and other such companies for modelling as well as some Indian modelling companies to show some of my cultural clothing off. I have done red carpet walks for many Indian Cultural events in front of hundreds of people which has always been one of my dreams ever since I was a kid and was a major goal I had growing up. When I was finally able to achieve it I had such a feeling of accomplishment that my love for modelling grew even more which has helped me to go out of my comfort zone and try new things and even try and go for acting. I played a minor role in an Indian movie called K.G.F., don’t get me wrong I had a blast being part of the crew but I feel as though acting isn’t really something that interests me so I didn’t pursue it much. I also took a gander at singing with a renowned Indian singer named Karan Aujla after which I worked with various other musicians throughout India and Canada. Singing has been such a good opportunity and I was lucky to be able to work with an artist such as Karan Aujla for my first song which helped me to boost my confidence in singing as many of his fans took a liking to the music we made together and we have even made 2 other songs together due to the success of our first song.<br><br>

        I am currently a Business Administration Major at University of California, Riverside. This is due to my family being into many different businesses which has always been intriguing to me and I am doing this degree to be able to help my parents in their different business ventures. This is also something that has always interested my family for generations as even my grandparents and great grandparents all had businesses of their own as well as owned land in many parts of the world. My love for business is almost as big as my love for modelling. I lived in the UK for around 3 years where I learned a lot about the business that my family had owned in the past and learned more about other businesses that interested me. One that really caught my eye was a Modeling Company that would help new models to find job opportunities, which really spoke to me as it made me look back at my beginning struggles as a model. I want to be able to help new upcoming models to be able to chase their dreams. This is a goal that my family is helping me to achieve whether it be with financial funding or helping me find people to help me achieve my dream of creating the organization. I am very close to being able to create a company for up and coming models. <br><br>
